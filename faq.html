                Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?
            </h1>
            <p class="answer">
                    No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like 
                    Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone.
                    Do not believe the claims of businesses who 
                    offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or 
                    an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the 
                    term “official” is just a way for vendors to 
                    sell their products or services to those who 
                    do not know better. Products or websites are 
                    not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. 
                    Each individual parade krewe is responsible for 
                    all of its merchandise. In some parts of the 
                    country, official organizations control their
                    Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true 
                    in New Orleans.

                    When does Mardi Gras start and end?
            </h1>
            <p class="answer active-faq">
                    The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, 
                    which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). 
                    Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on 
                    a different day each year.
                    Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter
                    Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. 
                    Fat Tuesday is always the day before Ash 
                    Wednesday.
                    Most visitors plan to arrive no later than 
                    the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay 
                    through Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page 
                    to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the 
                    next few years.

                    What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? 
                    What should I pack?
            </h1>
            <p class="answer">
                    The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from 
                    very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes 
                    it will change from one extreme to the other 
                    during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer 
                    your clothes since a chilly morning may turn 
                    into a warm afternoon.
                    Since you will be spending long days outside, 
                    pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get 
                    somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the 
                    forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, 
                    then you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!

                Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch 
                the parades go by?
            </h1>
            <p class="answer">
                The best option is to reserve a package in 
                the French Quarter or along the parade route 
                that offers a balcony, food and a bathroom 
                pass.

                How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?
            </h1>
            <p class="answer">
                It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave 
                with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. 
                That's why we call it the "Greatest Free 
                Show on Earth!"
