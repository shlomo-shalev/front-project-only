                    Mardi Gras in New Orleans
            </h1>
            <p>
                    The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all 
                    of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. 
                    Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks 
                    before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before 
                    Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western 
                    Christian tradition). Usually there is one major 
                    parade each day (weather permitting); many days 
                    have several large parades. The largest and most 
                    elaborate parades take place the last five days of 
                    the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, 
                    many events occur throughout New Orleans and 
                    surrounding communities, including parades and 
                    balls (some of them masquerade balls).
                    <br>
                    The parades in New Orleans are organized by social 
                    clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade 
                    schedule and route each year. The earliest-established 
                    krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, 
                    Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. 
                    Several modern "super krewes" are well known for 
                    holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe 
                    of Endymion (which is best known for naming 
                    celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), 
                    the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming 
                    celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu 
                    Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African 
                    American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws 
                    into the crowds. The most common throws are strings 
                    of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated 
                    plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive 
                    toys, but throws can also include lingerie and more 
                    sordid items. Major krewes follow the same parade 
                    schedule and route each year.
